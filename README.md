# 🇪🇺 Euro – The Social Network That Actually Makes Sense

## 🧠 What is Euro?

**Euro** is a modern, full-stack social network platform for thoughtful people who appreciate:

- 🧭 clear UX over noisy feeds
- 💬 meaningful interactions over mindless scrolls
- 🛠️ robust architecture over spaghetti code
- 🎩 and just a touch of elegance in every pixel

It’s not a clone. It’s a **clean room rethink** – designed to feel fresh, calm, and unapologetically confident.

## 🔧 Tech Stack (a.k.a. What’s Under the Hood)

### Frontend

- **React** + **TypeScript** (no magic, just logic)
- **SCSS modules** (BEM-style, because we’re civilized)
- **Tailwind CSS** _(in selective doses – minimalism matters)_

### Backend

- **Node.js** + **Express** + **TypeScript**
- **Dependency Injection** architecture (`@injectable()` all the way 🚰)
- **MongoDB** (flexible and pragmatic)
- Clean Layering: `Model → Repository → Service → Use Case → Controller`

## 🏛️ Architecture Philosophy

> “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.” – Einstein, or maybe your senior dev

This project follows **clear separation of concerns**, scalable modules, and a _“don’t surprise your future self”_ coding style.  
Every layer has its place – and no, business logic is not welcome in your controller, thank you very much.
